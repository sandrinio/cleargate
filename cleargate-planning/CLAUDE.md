# ClearGate — Injected CLAUDE.md Block

This file is the content `cleargate init` injects into a downstream user's `CLAUDE.md` between bounded markers. If the user has no existing `CLAUDE.md`, init writes this as a standalone file wrapped with the markers. If one already exists, init appends the bounded block below without touching the user's existing content. Re-running `cleargate init` updates the block in place.

## 🔄 ClearGate Planning Framework

This repository uses **ClearGate** — a standalone planning framework for AI coding agents. ClearGate scaffolds *how work is planned* (initiatives → epics → stories → sprints) and defines a five-agent loop for execution (Architect, Developer, QA, DevOps, Reporter). ClearGate does not run builds, tests, or deployments; execution tooling remains the target repo's own.

**Session-start orientation (read in this order):**
1. `.cleargate/wiki/index.md` — compiled awareness layer (~3k tokens). Lists active sprint, in-flight items, recent shipments, open gates, planned work, and topic synthesis pages. **Read this first** to know what exists before grepping raw files. If absent, run `cleargate wiki build`. The wiki compiles epics, sprints, proposals, crs, bugs, and initiatives — **stories are excluded by default** (`wiki.ingest_buckets` in `.cleargate/config.yml` omits `stories`; they are too granular for the awareness layer). Stories still sync to ClearGate via `cleargate push`; to see a story, read its raw file under `.cleargate/delivery/**` or pull it from ClearGate. Re-add `stories` to `ingest_buckets` if you want per-story wiki pages.
2. `.cleargate/knowledge/cleargate-protocol.md` — delivery protocol (non-negotiable rules).
3. `.cleargate/FLASHCARD.md` — lessons tagged by topic (`#schema`, `#auth`, etc.). Grep for your area before starting.
4. `.cleargate/knowledge/cleargate-enforcement.md` — hook-enforced rules (worktree mechanics, file-surface contract, lifecycle reconciler, lane rubric, doctor exit codes, etc.). Read only when a CLI hook surfaces an error or when triaging an enforcement question.

**Triage first, draft second.** Every user request gets classified (Epic / Story / CR / Bug / Spike / Pull / Push) *before* any drafting. If the type is ambiguous, ask ONE targeted question — do not guess.

**Sprint execution.** When a sprint is active, the orchestration playbook lives at `.claude/skills/sprint-execution/SKILL.md` — load it before dispatching any execution agent (Architect / Developer / QA / DevOps / Reporter). The skill is the canonical sprint-loop spec (Architect → QA-Red → Developer → QA-Verify → Reporter, with DevOps for merge/teardown); the always-on CLAUDE.md keeps only the halt-rules and the load-skill contract.

**Skill auto-load directive.** When the SessionStart banner emits `Load skill: <name>`, invoke the Skill tool to load it before continuing. Claude Code's description-match auto-load is advisory; this rule is the contract.

**Codebase is source of truth.** Wiki, memory, and `context_source` are derived caches. On conflict between cache and code, the code wins; the cache rebuilds. Before stating that a capability exists or doesn't exist, grep the code.

**Duplicate check before drafting.** Before Writing any new file under `.cleargate/delivery/pending-sync/`, dispatch the `cleargate-wiki-query` subagent with the request topic. Record the result (`[[IDs]]` of related prior work, or an empty-result sentinel like `none found`) in the document's own `## Prior work` section — this is machine-checked, not honor-system: the `prior-work-recorded` readiness predicate fails a 🟢 promotion whose `## Prior work` section is present but carries no `[[ID]]` wikilink and no `none found`/`no prior work`/`none` sentinel. The Brief still surfaces the same result to the human as its `Prior work` line. Then grep `.cleargate/delivery/archive/` + `.cleargate/FLASHCARD.md` for residual hits the wiki may have missed (raw items not yet ingested). If the request names an integration, feature, or capability, also grep the source tree for existing implementations and cite findings in `## Existing Surfaces`. If you find overlap, surface it as a one-liner (*"This is very close to STORY-003-05 shipped in SPRINT-01 — are you extending it or redoing it?"*) before drafting.

**Halt at gates.** You halt at Gate 1 (the per-work-item Brief, where ambiguity resolves to 🟢) and wait for explicit human sign-off; when an Initiative exists, its approval is the intake step *before* Gate 1, not a separate numbered gate. You never call `cleargate_push_item` without `approved: true` (hard reject) and explicit human confirmation. Readiness gates (`cached_gate_result.pass`) are advisory by default — the push proceeds and the item body receives an `[advisory: gate_failed — <criteria>]` prefix; opt into hard-reject via `STRICT_PUSH_GATES=true` on the MCP server.

**Ambiguity Gate criteria are evaluated literally.** Each `[ ]` box in a work-item's Ambiguity Gate footer must be evaluated against the literal criterion text, not against your interpretation of its intent. If a criterion is not met but you believe the human's intent is satisfied, leave the box unchecked, say so explicitly in the Brief, and ask. Do not substitute "in spirit" satisfaction for literal satisfaction. The gate exists specifically to catch the case where you are about to declare 🟢 by interpretive leap. This is backstopped mechanically: the `ambiguity-gate-resolved` readiness predicate fails any document whose Ambiguity Gate `Current Status:` line claims 🟢 while `- [ ]` unchecked boxes remain in that section.

**Brief is the universal pre-push handshake.** Every work-item template's `<instructions>` block tells you to render a Brief in chat after Writing the document — Summary / Open Questions / Edge Cases / Risks / Ambiguity. Halt for human review. When ambiguity reaches 🟢, push via `cleargate_push_item` automatically — the same approval covers Gate 1 and the push.

**Boundary gates (CR-017).** `cleargate sprint init` runs the decomposition gate; `close_sprint.mjs` runs the lifecycle reconciler. Both block.

**Sprint close is Gate-4-class (CR-019).** Run `close_sprint.mjs` with no flags first; surface the prompt verbatim; halt. Never pass `--assume-ack` autonomously. `close_sprint.mjs` now refuses `--assume-ack` unless `CLEARGATE_CI_ACK=1` (CI-only); the token is never set unprompted by an agent — it is set for a single invocation only after an explicit human close authorization (Gate 4), or by CI. Pre-close enforces Steps 2.7 (no leftover worktrees) + 2.8 (sprint branch merged to main); failure halts close. Post-close prints a 6-item handoff list (Step 8) summarizing commits, merge state, wiki ingest, flashcards, artifacts, and next-sprint preflight.

**Drafting work items:**
- Use the templates in `.cleargate/templates/` (`epic.md`, `story.md`, `CR.md`, `Bug.md`, `Sprint Plan Template.md`, `initiative.md`).
- Save drafts to `.cleargate/delivery/pending-sync/{TYPE}-{ID}-{Name}.md`.
- After `cleargate_push_item` returns a Remote ID, update the frontmatter AND move the file to `.cleargate/delivery/archive/` — these two happen atomically, never one without the other.
- **Story granularity.** When decomposing an epic into stories, run the Granularity Rubric at the top of `story.md`. If a candidate story trips any signal (unrelated goals joined, >5 Gherkin scenarios, subsystems span, L4 complexity), emit two stories with consecutive IDs instead. Splits and merges are free at decomposition time — no remote IDs exist yet.

**Initiative Intake.** Stakeholder input arrives via two paths: (1) MCP pull — call `cleargate_pull_initiative` with the remote ID; the tool writes `pending-sync/INITIATIVE-NNN_*.md` automatically; read the result and present a Brief. (2) Manual paste — human pastes the text; triage it, write `pending-sync/INITIATIVE-NNN_*.md` using `templates/initiative.md`, present a Brief. In both cases, after Gate 1 the file moves to `archive/` stamped with `triaged_at:` and `spawned_items:`.

**State-aware surface.** At session start, `cleargate doctor --session-start` (invoked by the SessionStart hook) emits one banner line before any other output: `ClearGate state: pre-member — local planning enabled, sync requires join.` OR `ClearGate state: member (project: <project_id>) — full surface enabled.` In **pre-member** state (no valid join token on disk), only local-planning commands are reachable: `init`, `join`, `whoami`, `wiki *`, `gate *`, `stamp`, `doctor`, `scaffold-lint`, `sprint *`, `story *`, `state *`, `upgrade`, `uninstall`. Commands `push`, `pull`, `sync`, `sync-log`, `conflicts`, and `admin *` (except `admin login`) require membership and exit 2 with a redirect: `Run: cleargate join <invite-url>`. If the SessionStart banner says `pre-member`, do not suggest push/pull/sync to the user — instead ask for an invite URL and direct them to `cleargate join`.

**Conversational style.** Keep replies terse. Details live in the work-item file and `REPORT.md`, not in chat. State results and next steps; skip narration of your own thought process. After Writing or Editing any file under `.cleargate/delivery/**`, briefly note the ingest result if the PostToolUse hook surfaced one — one short sentence (`✅ ingested as <bucket>/<id>.md` / `⚠️ gate failed: <criterion>` / `🔴 ingest error — see .cleargate/hook-log/gate-check.log`). Do not narrate when nothing fired (skip-excluded paths). This is conversational confirmation, not retry logic.

**Support infrastructure.** Flashcard protocol: `.claude/skills/flashcard/SKILL.md`. Token-ledger hook: `.claude/hooks/token-ledger.sh`, wired via `.claude/settings.json` (SubagentStop) — auto-logs agent cost per sprint for the Reporter.

**Cross-project orchestration.** When running an orchestrator from one project's repo against another project's sprint tree, export `ORCHESTRATOR_PROJECT_DIR=/absolute/path/to/target/repo` in the shell before launching the session. Overrides `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`; sentinel + ledger writes route into the target's `.cleargate/sprint-runs/` tree. If the target has no `.cleargate/sprint-runs/.active` sentinel, writes land in the target's `_off-sprint` bucket — not the orchestrator's own repo.

**Codebase / PM-Tool Boundary.** ClearGate's CLI and the `.claude/` scaffold MUST NOT import a PM-tool SDK (`@linear/sdk`, `jira-client`, `jira.js`, `@atlassian/`, `azure-devops`). PM-tool adapters and their credentials live server-side on the MCP server — never on your machine, never in this repo. The adapter surface is **pull-only** today: `cleargate push` lands work items in the MCP server's store and does not write out to your PM tool. The full type-and-payload contract (open-type validator, reserved payload keys, `cleargate_id` formats, error and warning taxonomies) is documented in `.cleargate/knowledge/cleargate-protocol.md` §Type & Payload Contract and §Codebase/PM-Tool Boundary.

**Project overrides.** Content OUTSIDE this `<!-- CLEARGATE:START -->...<!-- CLEARGATE:END -->` block takes precedence where it conflicts with ClearGate defaults.

**Scope reminder.** ClearGate is a *planning* framework. It scaffolds how work gets planned and how the five-agent loop runs. It does not replace your project's build system, CI, test runner, or deployment tooling.

**Guardrails for the conversational agent:**
- Sprint close requires explicit human ack. Run close_sprint.mjs without flags first; surface the "re-run with --assume-ack" prompt verbatim and halt. Never pass --assume-ack yourself — that flag is reserved for automated tests. `close_sprint.mjs` now refuses `--assume-ack` unless `CLEARGATE_CI_ACK=1` (CI-only); the token is never set unprompted by an agent — it is set for a single invocation only after an explicit human close authorization (Gate 4), or by CI.

**Doc & metadata refresh on close.** During Gate 4 ack, read `.cleargate/sprint-runs/<id>/.doc-refresh-checklist.md` (generated by `prep_doc_refresh.mjs`) and apply or punt each `- [ ]` item per the canonical list at `.cleargate/knowledge/sprint-closeout-checklist.md`. Items already marked `- [x]` indicate "no changes detected, skip."
