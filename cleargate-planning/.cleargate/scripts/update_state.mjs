/**
 * update_state.mjs — Atomic state/counter update for a story in state.json
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node update_state.mjs <STORY-ID> <new-state>          — transition to a new state
 *   node update_state.mjs <STORY-ID> --qa-bounce          — increment qa_bounces counter
 *   node update_state.mjs <STORY-ID> --arch-bounce        — increment arch_bounces counter
 *   node update_state.mjs <STORY-ID> --lane <standard|fast> — set lane for a story
 *   node update_state.mjs <STORY-ID> --lane-demote <reason> — demote story from fast lane
 *
 * CR-106: state.json is a DERIVED CACHE. `events.jsonl` (beside state.json) is the truth --
 * every action below is represented as an appended event (state-events.mjs's appendEvent), and
 * state.json is rebuilt by folding the whole log (state-events.mjs's fold) and rewriting the
 * cache via atomicWrite -- write to .tmp.<pid> file, then rename to final path. There is exactly
 * ONE `atomicWrite` call site left in this file, against the on-disk state document: the fold's
 * own write, at the end of main(). Idempotent: if new state equals current (for state transitions) and no genesis catch-up
 * is pending, exit 0 without appending an event or rewriting either file.
 *
 * Auto-escalation: when qa_bounces or arch_bounces reaches BOUNCE_CAP (3),
 *   state is automatically set to "Escalated". Reproduced by fold(), not by this file.
 *
 * Migration: reads v1 state.json transparently; upgrades to v2 on first touch
 *   (injects lane fields with defaults; emits one stderr log line) -- in-memory only now; the
 *   migrated document is persisted (if at all) through the single fold-and-write call below, not
 *   through its own atomicWrite.
 *
 * Legacy/log adoption: the first invocation against an active sprint that has no events.jsonl yet
 * synthesizes one genesis event per story from the (migrated) on-disk document before appending
 * its own action event -- see synthesizeGenesisEvents() in state-events.mjs. A CLOSED sprint
 * (sprint_status reaching its terminal value -- see TERMINAL_SPRINT_STATUSES) is never migrated,
 * never log-adopted, and never rewritten; it is refused with a controlled stderr.write + exit.
 *
 * Concurrency (BUG-044, retained per TPV ORCHESTRATOR RULING T3(a) on CR-106): events.jsonl's own
 * appends are safe without a lock (O_APPEND is atomic per writer on a regular file -- see
 * state-events.mjs's doc comment), but the read-log -> fold -> overwrite-state.json sequence is
 * still an unserialized read-modify-write on the DERIVED CACHE, and all 27 non-test readers read
 * that cache, not the log. So the whole pipeline below -- including genesis synthesis and both
 * migration steps -- stays serialized behind an exclusive lockfile at `<state.json>.lock`. See
 * acquireLock() for the retry/steal policy. The critical section is smaller than before (no more
 * whole-document read-modify-write; folding a JSONL log is cheap), but the mutual exclusion itself
 * is unchanged.
