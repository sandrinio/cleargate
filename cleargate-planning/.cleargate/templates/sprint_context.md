# Sprint Context

Per-sprint audit artefact. Populated at sprint init (M1 planning) and re-touched after each story merges. Referenced from every Developer/QA/Architect task brief so all agents start from the same baseline.

## Sprint Goal

_(populated by orchestrator from sprint plan §0 at kickoff)_

## Locked Versions

Frozen dependency versions for this sprint. Orchestrator populates from `package.json` snapshots at sprint init; Developers must not upgrade these mid-sprint without an explicit CR.

| Package | Version |
|---------|---------|
| Node    | `>=24.0.0` |
| TypeScript | `^5.8.0` |
| (add rows per workspace below) |  |

## Test Stack

Repo-derived test conventions. Written best-effort by `cleargate init` (detector); the
orchestrator may correct any field per-sprint. Agents read this block as OVERRIDING their
built-in defaults — Developer/QA/Architect use these values, not any hardcoded runner.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Backend runner    | _(e.g. `pytest -q` · `go test ./...` · `npm test` · populate at init)_ |
| Frontend runner   | _(e.g. js unit runner — blank if single-stack)_ |
| Typecheck command | _(e.g. `mypy .` · `tsc --noEmit` · blank if none)_ |
| Red-test naming   | _(e.g. `*.red.test.tsx` · `test_*_red.py` · `*_red_test.go` · populate at init)_ |

_If unresolved at init: leave the table stubbed. The pre-gate scan emits a one-line
"test_stack unresolved — populate sprint_context.md §Test Stack" advisory and treats the
typecheck/test gate as advisory (not FAIL) until populated. (§0.5 backstop decision.)_

## Cross-Cutting Rules

Sprint-wide architecture rules and UI/API tokens that every story must honour. Populated from the parent Epic's `<architecture_rules>` block.

1. (rule 1)
2. (rule 2)
3. (rule 3)

## Active FLASHCARD Tags

FLASHCARD tags that appear in any story's `<agent_context>` for this sprint. Auto-populated by grepping `.cleargate/FLASHCARD.md` at sprint init. Agents: grep the flashcard file for each tag listed here before starting work.

- `#tag1` — one-line summary of the most recent card
- `#tag2` — one-line summary

## Adjacent Implementations (Reuse First)

Exported helpers and modules from already-merged stories in this sprint. The Architect updates this section after each story merges. Developers check here before writing new helpers — if the module already exists, import it; duplication is a kick-back criterion.

| Story | Module / Export | Path |
|-------|----------------|------|
| (populated as stories merge) | | |

## Mid-Sprint Amendments

_(populated by Architect on CR:scope-change or CR:approach-change; never rewrite, only append. Format: '<ISO-ts> · <ID> · <one-line note>')_
